# OregonRail
 It is 1847. You have invented the world's first trackless, all-terrain locomotive, single-handedly revolutionizing the Oregon trailing industry. Show the world that dysentery can be outrun.

Created for Epic MegaJam 2023 (theme: ANTIQUATED FUTURE). This is a weird little Oregon Trail-themed OutRun-style game that explores using real 3D to simulate the fake 3D of 80's and early 90's driving games.



--INSTRUCTIONS--

Steer -- Left control stick, D-pad, WASD, arrow keys

Accelerate -- A button, right trigger, WASD, left shift, arrow keys

Brake -- B button, left trigger, WASD, left ctrl, arrow keys

Avoid slowpokes in wagons and get to Oregon before time runs out. If you have trouble taking corners, slow down -- you'll turn more sharply at low speeds!
